This is my code for the freeCodeCamp 25+5 timer project under the Front End Libraries projects. This is a rebuild of the project using React Hooks and CSS. The original build of the project was using the old Class-based components, and I thought it would be good practice to rebuild the old project with Hooks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Todo
>Address useEffect usage in timer to address bug that resets minutes value when breakDuration is changed -- something to do with how minutes is set up and the values tracked for the useEffect hook
>Update CSS
>Complete any necessary refactoring
